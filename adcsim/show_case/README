Ment to introduce this code to beginners.

0_intro starts with a simple integration problem using eulers method.

1_attitude_integration extends this concept to integrating the equations needed to propagate attitude (angular velocity and attitude differential equations at the same time)

2_iss_thing extends this a small amount to show that this 'cool thing' on youtube can be easily replicated.
